- Consistent backups in case of an emergency
- In case of a permanent shutdown, users will be notified at least one month in advance
- Hosted on a solution that allows at least 50 users
- Updates Sharkey on at least the stable channel no later than one month after a release is published
- Does run in either public mode or approval mode
- must use Sharkey or a fork that follows upstream
- Has a description, terms of service, and admin contact info (bonus points for an icon and background!)
- (At least one) administrator that is 16 years or older
- Allows the `JoinSharkey/0.1.0; +https://joinsharkey.org/join` UserAgent to query Nodeinfo and stats (used for the website)
